# LIBR

A Moderated, Censorship-Resilient Social Network Framework

## Overview

LIBR is a protocol for building digital public forums and social networks that are both provably censorship-resilient and safeguarded against harmful or illegal content.

Traditional centralized platforms (Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc.) control their own databases, which lets them remove or block content at will‚Äîundermining free expression. Fully decentralized networks avoid that single point of control, but without any moderation they may become overrun by offensive or malicious posts, turning communities chaotic rather than constructive.

LIBR strikes a balance by using a replicated DHT (Distributed Hash Table) setting for partial immutability‚Äîcheaper and faster than storing every message on a full blockchain‚Äîwhile storing necessary global configuration on a public Blockchain (eg., Ethereum). At the same time, content, for each community, is vetted (or approved) by a decentralized moderation quorum (a majority of moderators), so that no single moderator can decide the fate of a message. Only when a majority of moderators approve does a message get stored and shared, keeping the forum both open and safe.

## Architecture

LIBR is built with the following components:

1. **Protocol and Networking Layer (Go)**: The backbone of the system, implementing the DHT, cryptographic operations, moderation quorum mechanisms, and peer-to-peer communication.
2. **Blockchain Layer (Solidity)**: Smart contracts that manage global state, moderator registry, and community governance and incentivization.
3. **Web Client (React)**: User-friendly interface for interacting with LIBR communities.
4. **Mobile Client (Flutter)**: Native mobile experience for broader accessibility.

## Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Blockchain Interface**: Go Ethereum
- **Protocol and Networking Logic**: Go Lang
- **Web Client**: React
- **Mobile Client**: Flutter

## Getting Started

### Installation

Please see the [Installation Guide](./INSTALL.md) for setup instructions across Windows, Linux, and macOS.



## Project Structure

All source code is organized under the `src/` directory:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core-protocol/  # Go - Core LIBR protocol and moderation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ network/        # Go - P2P networking and DHT operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web-client/     # React/TypeScript - Web interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mobile-client/  # Flutter/Dart - Mobile application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contracts/      # Solidity - Smart contracts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/          # Integration and end-to-end tests
```

### Language Guidelines by Directory
