While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * ‚ö°Ô∏è `:zap:` when improving performance
    * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs

### Changelog Management

We maintain a [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format. 

#### For Contributors:
- **DO NOT** directly edit the changelog
- Use conventional commit messages that can be automatically parsed
- Your changes will be automatically added to the changelog during release

#### Conventional Commit Format:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature (correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning)
- `fix`: A bug fix (correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(core): add DHT node discovery mechanism
fix(web-client): resolve connection timeout issues
docs(readme): update installation instructions
perf(core): optimize message validation algorithm
```

#### Breaking Changes:
For breaking changes, add `!` after the type/scope:
```bash
feat(core)!: redesign moderation quorum API
```

Or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:
```bash
feat(core): redesign moderation quorum API

BREAKING CHANGE: The moderationQuorum.validate() method now requires
an additional parameter for consensus threshold.
```

#### Commit Message Validation

We provide a script to validate your commit messages locally:

```bash
# Validate a commit message
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "feat(core): add DHT node discovery mechanism"

# Example of invalid message
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "added new feature"  # ‚ùå Will fail

# Example of valid messages
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "feat(core): add DHT node discovery"     # ‚úÖ Valid
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "fix(web-client): resolve timeout"       # ‚úÖ Valid
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "docs: update installation guide"        # ‚úÖ Valid
```

This helps ensure your commits will be properly included in the automated changelog generation.

## Additional Notes

### Release Process

LIBR follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and automated changelog generation:

1. **Automated Changelog**: The changelog is automatically updated during releases based on conventional commit messages
2. **Version Bumping**: Versions are determined automatically:
   - `fix:` commits trigger PATCH releases (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.1.1)
   - `feat:` commits trigger MINOR releases (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.2.0)
   - `BREAKING CHANGE:` triggers MAJOR releases (0.1.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0)
3. **Release Notes**: Generated automatically from commit messages and PR descriptions

### Maintainer Responsibilities

For maintainers creating releases:
1. Ensure all PRs use conventional commit messages
2. Review and merge PRs following the pull request guidelines
3. Create releases through GitHub's release interface
4. The changelog will be automatically updated with properly categorized changes

**üìö For detailed maintainer guidance:** See [docs/MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md](docs/MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md) for best practices on working with new contributors.

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

* `bug` - Issues with the code
* `documentation` - Issues with the documentation
* `enhancement` - Feature requests
* `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
* `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
* `question` - Further information is requested
* `wontfix` - This will not be worked on

## üåø Branch Naming & Workflow Guidelines

To keep our project organized, please follow these simple guidelines for naming your branches:

### üìù Simple Branch Naming

**Keep it simple and descriptive!** Use names that clearly explain what you're working on:

```bash
# ‚úÖ Good examples - simple and clear
add-login-button
fix-mobile-crash
update-readme
improve-dark-mode
add-search-feature
fix-typo-in-docs

# ‚ùå Avoid these - too vague or complex  
my-changes
stuff
fix
new-feature
type/scope/very-long-description-that-is-hard-to-read
```

### üí° Branch Naming Tips

**For new contributors:**
- **Be descriptive** but keep it short
- **Use dashes** instead of spaces (`add-login` not `add login`)
- **Start with action words** like `add`, `fix`, `update`, `improve`
- **Don't worry about perfect formatting** - clarity is more important!

**Examples by type of work:**
```bash
# Adding something new
add-user-profile
add-search-bar
add-mobile-support

# Fixing bugs
fix-login-error
fix-broken-link
fix-mobile-layout

# Updating documentation
update-installation-guide
fix-readme-typos
add-api-docs

# Improving existing features
improve-loading-speed
enhance-user-interface
optimize-database-queries
```

### üîÑ Workflow Steps

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/libr.git
   cd libr
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   # Always start from the latest main branch
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   
   # Create your feature branch with a simple, descriptive name
   git checkout -b add-user-profile
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**
   ```bash
   # Make your changes, then stage them
   git add .
   
   # Use conventional commit messages
   git commit -m "feat: add user profile page with avatar upload"
   ```

4. **Keep Your Branch Updated**
   ```bash
   # Regularly sync with main to avoid conflicts
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

5. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   # Push your branch
   git push origin feat/web/user-profile-page
   
   # Then create a Pull Request on GitHub
   ```

### ‚úÖ Branch Best Practices

- **Keep branches focused** - One feature/fix per branch
- **Use descriptive names** - Others should understand what you're working on
- **Keep branches short-lived** - Aim to merge within a few days
- **Delete merged branches** - Clean up after your PR is merged
- **Rebase instead of merge** - Keep history clean

### üö´ Branch Names to Avoid

```bash
# Too vague - what are you fixing/updating?
fix
update
my-changes
stuff

# Too long - keep it concise
create-a-new-user-authentication-system-with-oauth-and-jwt-tokens

# Hard to read - use dashes, not underscores or capitals
fix_login_bug
NEW-FEATURE
userauth
```

### üîß Branch Management Commands

```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Delete local branch after merge
git branch -d add-user-profile

# Delete remote branch  
git push origin --delete add-user-profile

# Clean up merged branches
git branch --merged main | grep -v main | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
```

Thank you for your contributions to LIBR!
