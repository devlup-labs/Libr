=======
git remote add upstream https://github.com/libr-forum/libr.git
>>>>>>> 9778abfea970abad1ec6f572173b51b742c8068d
```

### 2. Install Required Tools
Make sure you have these installed on your computer:

- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Go 1.21+** - [Download here](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)

## 📁 Understanding the Project Structure

LIBR is organized into different folders for different programming languages:

```
src/
├── core-protocol/  # 🔧 Go code - Core LIBR protocol
├── network/        # 🌐 Go code - P2P networking
├── web-client/     # 🔵 React/TypeScript - Website
├── mobile-client/  # 🟣 Flutter/Dart - Mobile app
├── contracts/      # 🟡 Solidity - Blockchain contracts
└── tests/          # 🔴 All tests
```

**Which folder should you work in?**
- **New to programming?** Start with `src/web-client/` (website)
- **Know JavaScript/TypeScript?** Work in `src/web-client/`
- **Know mobile development?** Work in `src/mobile-client/`
- **Know Go/backend?** Work in `src/core-protocol/` or `src/network/`
- **Know blockchain?** Work in `src/contracts/`

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Step 1: Pick an Issue
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/libr-forum/libr/issues)
=======
1. Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/libr-forum/libr/issues)
>>>>>>> 9778abfea970abad1ec6f572173b51b742c8068d
2. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` - these are perfect for beginners!
3. Comment "I'd like to work on this" on the issue you choose

### Step 2: Create a Branch With a Good Name
```bash
# Always create a new branch for your work
git checkout -b your-branch-name

# 😊 Simple, descriptive names work best!
# Examples of GREAT branch names:
git checkout -b add-login-button
git checkout -b fix-spelling-error  
git checkout -b update-readme
git checkout -b dark-mode-theme

# 🚫 Avoid these branch names:
# git checkout -b my-changes        # Too vague
# git checkout -b fix               # What fix?
# git checkout -b new-stuff         # What stuff?
```

**💡 Branch Naming Tips:**
- **Use short, clear descriptions** of what you're doing
- **Use dashes** instead of spaces (`add-login-button` not `add login button`)
- **Be specific** but not too long (`fix-login-bug` is better than `fix-the-bug-where-login-doesnt-work`)
- **Examples that work well:**
  - `add-search-bar`
  - `fix-mobile-layout`
  - `update-installation-docs`
  - `improve-error-messages`
- `web/` - Website (React)
- `mobile/` - Mobile app (Flutter)
- `core-protocol/` - Core LIBR logic (Go)
- `network/` - P2P networking (Go)
- `contracts/` - Blockchain (Solidity)

### Step 3: Make Your Changes
- Work on your feature/fix in the appropriate `src/` folder
- Test your changes locally
- Make sure your code works before submitting

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes
Use our simple commit message format (more details below):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user login button"
```

### Step 5: Push and Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin my-feature-name
# Then go to GitHub and click "Create Pull Request"
```

## ✍️ Writing Good Commit Messages

We use a simple format that helps us track what changes were made:

### Format: `type: description`

**Types you can use:**
- `feat:` - Adding a new feature
- `fix:` - Fixing a bug
- `docs:` - Updating documentation
- `style:` - Changing colors, fonts, layout
- `test:` - Adding tests

### ✅ Good Examples:
```bash
feat: add login button to homepage
fix: correct spelling mistake in README
docs: update installation instructions
style: change button color to blue
test: add test for user registration
```

### ❌ Bad Examples:
```bash
"fixed stuff"           # Not descriptive
"Added feature"         # Missing type
"feat added login"      # Wrong format
```

### 🔍 Check Your Commit Message
Before committing, you can test your message:
```bash
# Test if your commit message is correct
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "feat: add login button"
```

If it shows ✅, you're good to go! If it shows ❌, fix the format.
